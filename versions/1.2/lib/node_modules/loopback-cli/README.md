# loopback-cli
v0.0.1

A simple module for surfacing the loopback-workspace API over the command line.

## Install

    slnode install loopback-cli -g
    
## Workspaces

Loopback projects are organized into workspaces. Workspaces allow you to setup development environments for authoring and editing Loopback projects. See [loopback-workspace](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-workspace) for more info.

Initialize a workspace.

    $ lb workspace my-workspace

This will create a workspace directory in `my-workspace`.

## Creating Apps

Create a Loopback application in your workspace directory.

    $ cd my-workspace
    $ lb create my-first-loopback-app
    

## Creating Models

Create a model in an existing Loopback application by following the prompts.

    $ cd my-first-loopback-app
    $ lb model product -i
  
**Note:** specifying the `-i` or `--interactive` flag will prompt you to define your model's configuration. If you wish to create an empty model config, do not supply this flag.
